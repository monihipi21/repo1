A Google Chromecast is an inexpensive piece of streaming kit. The Chromecast Ultra is more expensive, but at under $100 it remains affordable. But some parts of the world are restricted from buying Chromecasts.

The solution? A DIY alternative based on the Raspberry Pi. Costing under $50, you can configure this credit card-sized computer to receive media streamed from an Android app.

Let me explain how to use your Raspberry Pi like a DIY Chromecast with Raspicast.
Start by installing Raspicast on your Android device. This is a free app that connects to your Raspberry Pi and streams data to it. You'll find Raspicast in the Google Play app store. Unfortunately, there is no reliable iPhone alternative for this.
Than you will see how easy it is with next steps!
